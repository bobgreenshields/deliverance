Frik will surrender as soon as it becomes clear that the goblins will lose.  He says that he is not like the other goblins (true, he is much smarter) and that he will help the pcs.  He will run and/or attack the pcs at the first chance that he thinks he is safe to get away with it.

* He was helping Vrox because he doesn't like fighting
* Klarg has changed - it's the thing on his face
* These caves are bad
* He can show them where the treasure is
