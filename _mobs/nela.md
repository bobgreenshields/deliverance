Nela Hillwater is an old lady held captive by the goblins.

She is hobbled by leather straps and carries buckets full of water with a wooden cup for the goblins to drink.

* She knows the layout of the caves as far as the palisade
* She's only done water for 2 days
* Ussoll did the water but she disappeared - she doesn't think she escaped
* She's really scared; Ussoll disappearing, the goblins and the sickness
* Humans and goblins are falling sick
* One human has already died in a violent gruesome death
* He appeared to die and then woke up and attacked another
* Another is sick and some captives want to kill her
* Klarg looks like he has the sickness
* Draenog, the bugbear, argues with Klarg
