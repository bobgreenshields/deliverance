Nela Hillwater is an old lady held captive by the goblins.

She is hobbled by leather straps and carries buckets full of water with a wooden cup for the goblins to drink.

* She knows the layout of the caves as far as the palisade
* She's only done water for 2 days
* She fills her bucket from the river in the captives cave and takes to the goblins
* Ussoll did the water but she disappeared - she doesn't think she escaped
* There is something else in here.  She's seen it in the shadows
* Seen it both in the captives cave and by the bridge
* She's really scared; Ussoll disappearing, the goblins and the sickness
* She is too scared to join the party or run away
* Humans and goblins are falling sick
* One human has already died in a violent gruesome death
* He appeared to die and then woke up and attacked another
* Another is sick and some captives want to kill her
* Klarg looks like he has the sickness
* Draenog, the bugbear, argues with Klarg
* Draenog patrols the caves and passages every couple of hours
