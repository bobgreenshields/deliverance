    To investigate the frieze the corridor must be traversed and an investigate check made.

    The frieze seems to be depicting a story that contains the following events

    * battlefields covered in the slain
    * armies of undead are assaulted by a tide of men, dwarves, dragons and giants
    * aging kings being made young again
    * vast constructions being made by legions of slaves
    * mass battles between armies of men, some aided by undead armies
    * these battles often involve other races alongside the men and undead
    * mages involved in complex rituals and casting
    * a great leader being paid homage to by kings of several races including humans, dwarves and giants
    * ancient cities and castles of great grandeur

    **Int (Investigation) check**
    * DC 16 the elves never seem to be battling against the undead
    * DC 14 the elves are always standing behind the great leader

- title: "The tracks"
  desc: |-
    The tracks lead off into the gloom.

    If they are followed they reveal a secret door half way down on the left hand side.  It would have been challenging to spot if not for the tracks leading into the wall at this point.

    **DC 16 Int (Investigation) check** the secret door can be opened by manipulating various parts of the fireze

    After a couple of minutes the door opens regardless of the party's success.
