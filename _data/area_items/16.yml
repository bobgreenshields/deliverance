    The ghoul locks the door with the lever and the runes on the obelisks glow with life.

    The souls chained to the obelisks open their eyes but have wild, empty stares as they thrash and their mouths move in silent screams.

  desc: |-
    The floor is covered in pointed white shards surrounded by a fine pale dust.  Bone.

- title: "Obelisks"

    Chained to each rune carved obelisk is a limp, semi-concious figure.

- title: "Lever"
  desc: |-
    There is a mechanism with a lever of unknown purpose!
    It is used to lock and unlock the secret door.

- title: "Statues"
  desc: |-
    Towards each corner are statues.  Just for decoration.

- title: "Pit"

    There is a large pit in the centre of the chamber that starts to pulse with an ominous light once the door is locked and the obelisks begin to drain life force from the sacrifices.
