- title: "C: In the river - steep river banks"
  desc: |-
    The river banks are steep flowstone. You are not visible when down in the river and the sound of the water covers the noise of movement. 

    * **DC 15 Str (Climb) check** to scale quietly, failure makes noise.
    * **DC 15 Wis (Perception) check** to spot a goblin belt and sword sheath caught on a rock upstream.
