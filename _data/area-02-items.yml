    Several web covered orbs nestled in the alcove near the entrance at C.  The webs firmly fix them into place.

    * **DC 18 Wis (Perception) check** to spot another nest of eggs at B.
    * **DC 15 Int (Investigation) check** the orbs are vibrating and undulating slightly, there's something in there and it might be trying to get out.
    * **DC 20 Int (Investigation) check** after a couple of rounds they are moving more than before.  The closer the proximity of bodies the more they vibrate.

    They can be opened using a sharp edge.

    * Smaller - is a dessicated goblin.  Describe the dessicated skin and shrivelled flesh. See Loot.
    * 1st man sized - is a dessicated human
