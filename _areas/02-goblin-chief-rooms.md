The entrance crack widens out quickly enough but it rapidly becomes apparent that this cave has been home to something arachnoid at sometime.  Fine webs cover regions of the walls and on the ceiling they mesh with finger width strands.  With the hanging webs it is hard to judge the full extent of the cave but it is clear that on the opposite wall it narrows and continues as a tunnel.

* [**DC 20 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) a giant spider is hidden on the ceiling above the entrance.
* [**DC 18 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) at C darker man sized shadowy regions.
* [**DC 18 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) at B web covered orbs.

## A: Spider eggs

Several web covered orbs nestled in the alcove near the entrance at C.  The webs firmly fix them into place.

* [**DC 18 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) to spot another nest of eggs at B.
* [**DC 15 Int (Investigation) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) the orbs are vibrating and undulating slightly, there's something in there and it might be trying to get out.
* [**DC 20 Int (Investigation) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) after a couple of rounds they are moving more than before.  The closer the proximity of bodies the more they vibrate.

## B: Spider eggs

## C: Cocooned bodies

Not visible from the entrance but there are 3 web cocoons suspended from the web at A.

[**DC 15 Int (Investigation) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) they contain 2 man sized and 1 smaller than man sized humanoids

They can be opened using a sharp edge.

* Smaller - is a dessicated goblin.  Describe the dessicated skin and shrivelled flesh. See Loot.
* 1st man sized - is a dessicated human
* 2nd man sized - describe the first patch of dessicated dried skin just as with the other two.  This cocoon contains an initially inanimate ghoul.  It suddenly opens its eyes and viciously attacks. See Loot.
