Vrox & Gribble by the bench, 2 goblins sitting by the brazier.  

Vrox, the alchemist, and Gribble, his unhappy assistant, work here manufacturing potions and use exploding toads to make the bombs that the goblins use.

* [**DC 20 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) interesting

**Timer** 1d3-1 toads hop out of the pen and attack the party.
