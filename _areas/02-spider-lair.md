The entrance crack widens out quickly enough but it rapidly becomes apparent that this cave has been home to something arachnoid at sometime.  Fine webs cover regions of the walls and on the ceiling they mesh with finger width strands.  With the hanging webs it is hard to judge the full extent of the cave but it is clear that on the opposite wall it narrows and continues as a tunnel.

* [**DC 20 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) a giant spider is hidden on the ceiling above the entrance.
* [**DC 18 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) at C darker man sized shadowy regions.
* [**DC 18 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) at B web covered orbs.
