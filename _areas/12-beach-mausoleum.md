The tunnel enclosing the river turns into a large cave bordered by a shallow beach.

The back wall of the cave is broken by a pair of strong metal doors.  These doors are locked with no sign of a keyhole.  The are extremely robustly built and it's obvious that force, at least lacking a battering ram, is not going to open them.

In the middle of each door is a smooth panel the has a distinct depression shaped like a truncated triangle.  It is the same shape and size as the pendant taken from the ghoul in the spider cave.  If the pendant is placed in either depression the doors will unlock and can be opened.  They have handles on the inside that can be used to open or close them.

* DC 10 drag marks across the gravel leading from the water up the beach towards the doors
