The river flows shin deep but swiftly through a 15ft. deep chasm.  A makeshift bridge crosses it at the narrowest point.  The goblins have a barricade on the far side of the river that can be pulled across the end of the bridge.

* The river noise over the rocks will cover quiet movement.
* Downstream the roar of water can be heard (underground waterfall).
* [**DC 12 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) the goblins have long 2 handed spears.  Reach 10ft. attract opp. att. if closing across bridge.
* [**DC 13 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) one of the goblin archers has a very high quality non-goblin looking quiver of arrows.
* [**DC 15 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) one of the goblins has a horn.
* [**DC 14 Dex check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) to stay on bridge if hit by melee attack whilst crossing.
