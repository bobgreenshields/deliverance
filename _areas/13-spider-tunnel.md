The cave narrows as it winds its way into the hillside.  After about 20 ft the first evidence of webs appear.  At first just fine strands then webs on the walls and ceilings.  The web coverage increases as the cave penetrates the hill.  At first odd webs, which become more frequent.  Then they begin to link up as some of the strands become thicker and stickier.  Large hand sized spiders can be seen moving around amongst the webs 

* [**DC 14 Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) a 2ft white orb hangs from the ceiling at A.
