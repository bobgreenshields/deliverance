It's immediately apparent that this cave is occupied and not only by the poor wretch who is tied to a wooden frame and obviously being beaten and tortured.

A goblin and archer at E alternately sitting on the box or striking/stabbing Glamraes.

The dwarf, Glamraes Goldenbrand, is the caravan master that the party has been tasked to find.

**Timer** until mob J (2G, 1A) arrives - if Klarg is absent he comes with them.
